# Visual_attention_task
Here you find the code in Python 3.7.6, implemented with the open-source package OpenSesame (OS) 3.3.9, for a computerized choice reaction time task we use in the clinic to measure visual attention and eye movements.

In Visual_attention_task.osexp you find the code to run the game. You need to change the path to the Image folder (here as Images.zip).

External hardware needed:
1) compatible Eye Tracker (we use a Tobii Pro Nano, Tobii Technology, Danderyd, Sweden). Number of eye tracker needs to be changed in the code to be detected by the program.
2) TTL trigger (we use a compatible GPIO, 5V DC relays, Numato Lab) 

For more details on the outputs of the task you can read https://doi.org/10.1177/15500594221129962
